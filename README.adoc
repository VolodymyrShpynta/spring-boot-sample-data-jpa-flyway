== Spring Boot Flyway Sample

This sample demonstrates the flyway auto-configuration support.

You can look at `http://localhost:8080/spring-boot-flyway-sample/flyway` to review the list of scripts.

This sample also enables the H2 console (at `http://localhost:8080/spring-boot-flyway-sample/h2-console`)
so that you can review the state of the database (the default connection options are:

`JDBC URL: jdbc:h2:mem:testdb`

 `User Name: sa`

 `Pasword: <leave this empty>`).
